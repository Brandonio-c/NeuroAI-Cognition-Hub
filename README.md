## About Neuro-Symbolic AI

Neuro-symbolic AI is an interdisciplinary approach that combines symbolic reasoning with neural networks to create more advanced and intelligent AI systems. This repository will provide links to research papers, articles, and tools that explore this integration.

## Cognition in AI

Cognition within AI is an essential aspect of building machines that can think and understand like humans. We've gathered resources related to cognitive models, cognitive architectures, and AI systems that simulate human-like thinking processes.
